tirreno is announcing version v0.9.5.

The new release focuses on user review and blacklisting automation. There are new thresholds that allow you to choose when a flagged user should be manually reviewed or immediately auto-blacklisted. Additionally, new search filters make it easy to work with Trust Scores, and there is a new API endpoint to integrate tirreno blacklist logic into your application.
